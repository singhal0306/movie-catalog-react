# Movie Catalog React App

The Movie Catalog React Application is a responsive web application designed to elegantly display a curated list of 100 movies. Utilizing React.js, Redux for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling, this application seamlessly showcases detailed information and images for each film, ensuring an immersive browsing experience across both desktop and mobile browsers.

## Features

1. Movie Display: The application presents a comprehensive list of 100 movies, complete with images and detailed information such as title, language, country, and genre.
2. Responsive Design: Leveraging Tailwind CSS, the interface is optimized for responsiveness, dynamically adjusting its layout and styling to provide an optimal viewing experience on various screen sizes and devices.
3. Filtering Functionality: Users can filter movie selections based on Language, Country, or Genre, allowing them to narrow down the list and find films that match their preferences.
4. State Management with Redux: Redux is used for state management, providing a centralized store for managing application state and enabling efficient data flow between React components.
